As of right now, I am in the middle of my senior season at George fox, and look forward to finishing this season strong.  I have been injured in the first four games and look to make a comeback soon and contribute to our team on the field.  We are currently 3-1 (10/5) and are striving to win a conference championship this year for the first time in school history.

When looking forward to after this season, I hope to accumulate all my film and find a sports agent to give my stats and highlights to. I will then see if he can get me in contact with a professional football league in the U.S, Canada, or overseas in Europe.
